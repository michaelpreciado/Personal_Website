# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable HTML components and templates that can be included in multiple pages.

## Purpose

The components directory is intended to store HTML fragments that are used across multiple pages. This helps maintain consistency and makes updates easier by centralizing common elements.

## Usage

Components can be included in your HTML pages using server-side includes, client-side JavaScript templates, or by copying the markup directly when building pages.

## Component Types

- **Layout Components**: Header, footer, sidebar, and other structural elements
- **UI Components**: Cards, buttons, form elements, and other reusable UI patterns
- **Page Sections**: Reusable page sections like hero areas, feature sections, etc.

## Future Development

For a more robust component system, consider implementing a templating language or build system that can automatically include components during the build process.
